Follow these steps to run the code sucessfully!
1. Download or copy the code files and images. 
2. Create a HTML file on your desktop (HTMLCode.html).
3. Paste the HTML code in the same file.
4. Create CSS file on your desktop (CSSCode.css).
5. Paste the CSS code in the css file created.
6. Run the HTML code by using any HTML Editor. ( I prefer Sblime Text)
7. Done.

NOTE:
1. All the images and code files should be in same folder

like, [link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"> </head]
