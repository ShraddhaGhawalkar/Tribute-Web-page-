<p>
		ü™ê Kalpana Chawla (17 March 1962 ‚Äì 1 February 2003) was an Indian-born American astronaut and aerospace engineer who was the first woman of Indian origin to go to space. <br><br>

		ü™ê It was the dream that many Indians dreamt of but only Kalpana was able to fulfill it. She had various ambitions in minds from her childhood only. Moreover, she always had an interest in aircraft, and because of that, she took aeronautical engineering. <br><br>

		ü™ê Furthermore, Kalpana was a woman of great patience and hard work. And she proved that nothing is impossible if you have true dedication for your work. According to her teachers, Kalpna always had a great interest in Science. <br><br>
		
		ü™ê She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist and primary robotic arm operator. <br><br>

		ü™êHer second flight was on STS-107, the final flight of Columbia, in 2003. Chawla was one of the seven crew members who died in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster when the spacecraft disintegrated during its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere on 1 February 2003. <br><br>

		ü™ê Chawla was posthumously awarded the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, and several streets, universities, and institutions have been named in her honor. <br><br>

		ü™ê On 2 December 1983, Kalpana Chawla was married to Jean-Pierre Harrison at the age of 21.
